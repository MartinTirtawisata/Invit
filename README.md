## Demo

## Limitations
There are a few functionality from the app that I had to cut from the project scope due to the lack of time available. It will be implemented further overtime.
1) Need user feedback when navigating through the website
2) Logged in user needs to be given a session
3) API access to their account needs to be protected 
4) User needs to be able to logout
5) Items and products needs to be assigned to the appropriate user who created them.
