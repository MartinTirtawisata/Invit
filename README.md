# NodE-Commerce
NodE-Commerce is an e-commerce app that allows the user to sell items online. The user will be able to add, edit, and delete the items in their listing. 

## Demo
Heroku

## Limitations
There are a few functionality from the app that I had to cut from the project scope due to the lack of time available. It will be implemented further overtime.
1) When adding a new product, the browser has to be reloaded due to the inconsistency of the http request
2) When updating a product, the browser has to be reloaded due to the inconsistency of the http request
3) Logged in user needs to be given a session, and protected API to have access to their account
4) Items and products needs to be assigned to the appropriate user who created them.
